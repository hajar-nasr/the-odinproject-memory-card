# Memory Card Game

This is [a memory card game](https://hajar-nasr.github.io/the-odinproject-memory-card/) built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. The goal of the game is to click on each card only once. The cards shuffle after every click, and clicking the same card twice ends the game.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Features

- **React** for building the UI.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling.
- **Framer Motion** for animations.
- Fetches Pokémon images dynamically from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
